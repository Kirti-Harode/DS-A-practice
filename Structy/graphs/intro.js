// 1) Difference between directed graph and undirected graph:
// In a directed graph, edges can only be traveled in one direction. In an undirected graph, edges can be traveled both ways.


// 2) data structure to keep track of visited nodes
//  set is wll suited data structure to keep track of nodes beacuse it has constant lookup, insertion, deleteion time

// 3) difference between graph and tree
//  A graph may not have a 'root' and there may be multiple paths between two nodes. In tree
// there is only one single unique path between two nodes


// 4) algorithm to find shortest path between two nodes
//  BFS, all directions are explored evenly

// 5) data structure for adjacency list
// an Object is best suited where each node id points to an array of the node's neighbors

// 6) ways to represent graphs
//  Adjacency List, Edge-list, Grid graph etc....
