//  Chris is playing the racing car arcade game: in this game, Chris is controlling a car that can move sideways but the car keeps moving forward at all times. Chris can move the car into any lane at any moment, when changing lanes, the race car can move through an obstacle.
// 

// It can move to a line that is occupied. For example if the race cars in line 1 and line 2 is occupied he can move laundry but not to rain there are some obstacles on the track.
// there are three lanes in the game and Chris starts the game from the middle lane. Deter mine the minimum sideways moment needed in order to complete the game. Note that a  movement at one moment be it from lane 1 to lane 2 or from lane 1 to lane 3 it counted as a single moment.


// STDIN    Function
// -----    --------
//     →   obstacleLanes[] size n = 3
//    →   obstacleLanes = [2, 1, 2]
// output: 1
// Chris can move the car to third Lane in the first second and will not need to move the car I can refer to the image of the problem statement.
