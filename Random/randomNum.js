// You are given :

// 1. a function that generates a random number between 0 and 1 (e.g. Math.random())
// 2. an inscribed circle with a radius of 1
// 3. the distance between two points can be calculated with: distance = sqrt( x^2 + y^2 )

// Write a function estimatePi(n) that uses randomly generated points to estimate pi where n is the number of points plotted. 
// A higher n value should yield a more accurate estimate.
