//  A schedule has just been released for an upcoming tech conference. 
//  The schedule provides the start and end times for each of the presentations. 
//  Once the presentation has begun no one can enter or leave the room. 
//  It takes no time to go from one presentation to another. 
//  Determine the maximum number of presentations that can be attending by one person.


// Example: 
// n = 3
// scheduleStart = [1, 1, 2]
// scheduleEnd =   [3, 2, 4]
// Using 0-based indexing, an attendee could attend any presentation alone, or both presentations 1 and 2. 
// Presentation 0 ends too late to be able to attend presentation 2afterwards. 
// The maximum number of presentation one person can attend is 2.
